# Personal Site

Basic personal website alongside a few pages demonstrating DOM manipulation and Handlebars. 

Deployed at: [https://sharp-lichterman-f8863a.netlify.app/](https://sharp-lichterman-f8863a.netlify.app/).

## Task List

Utilizes basic DOM manipulation for an app that will allow users to add and remove items from a list. These tasks can be marked as pending or complete with differing task priorities.

## Quiz App

Uses Handlebars to create an SPA quiz application. Users can take different quizzes and get a score at the end.

Quiz data is retrieved from a fake REST server using [My JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/).

## Course Search App

Main repo: [https://github.com/aethyris/course-search](https://github.com/aethyris/course-search).

Utilizes Handlebars and a RESTful API deployed on Heroku to implement a SPA for searching database for courses.
